# ai-gm-core

## What this is

**ai-gm-core** is not a game engine.

It is a core concept and experimental framework for an **AI Game Master** that interprets **player actions themselves as prompts**, and returns **world consequences as narrative context**.

No scores.
No win/lose conditions.
No real-time synchronization required.

The world moves forward — even if the player does nothing.

---

## Core idea

Traditional games ask players to input commands.
ai-gm-core observes **behavior**.

* What the player did
* What the player did not do
* Where the player hesitated
* What the player repeatedly avoided

These actions become the prompt.

The AI does not judge correctness.
It **interprets intent** and advances the world accordingly.

---

## What this is NOT

* Not a full game
* Not a simulation engine
* Not a real-time MMO system
* Not a replacement for human creativity

This repository exists to explore **structure**, not content.

---

## Design principles

* World-agnostic
* Genre-agnostic
* Player-skill-agnostic
* Asynchronous by default
* Narrative-first, not mechanics-first

Different worlds can be created by changing context —
not by rewriting the core logic.

---

## Status

This project is **early-stage and experimental**.

At this point, the repository serves as:

* a conceptual anchor
* a public timestamp
* a place for discussion and iteration

Implementation details will evolve over time.

---

## Why public?

Because ideas benefit from being seen.

If this concept resonates with you, feel free to watch, fork, or discuss.
